## Motivation

As the number of accounts created increases, it has become hard to collect and save all the passwords safely in one location. And hence I built this python application to create a database that keeps track of all your account usernames and passwords.

## Installation

**Prerequisites** : Python 3 and Cryptography module.

For the latest stable version, head to [Releases](https://github.com/SVijayB/Password-Manager/releases).

Download and extract the source code.

As an alternative, you could also clone the repository using,

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/SVijayB/Password-Manager.git
</pre>

Before running the application, you need to install the [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) module. To do so, launch your terminal and type `pip install cryptography`. Once completed, you are ready to use the application.

You can also cd to the Password-Manager directory on your terminal and type 

<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

## Usage

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/SS.PNG" alt="SS" border="0">
</p>

Run the `Password_manager.py` file present in the `src` folder.

You can do that by just double clicking on the file if you have the *python launcher* installed. Else, **`cd/`** to the **`src`** folder and type `python Password_manager.py`.

Once you have it running, follow the instructions given by the application.

You can use this along with the [Safe Haven](https://github.com/SVijayB/Safe-Haven) application for added security measures.
